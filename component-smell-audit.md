## Angular Component Review: Architectural Integrity

Analyze the provided Angular Component (TypeScript file and template) to ensure optimal architecture and clean code practices. Focus on diagnosing common "Component Smells."

Specifically, critique the component's adherence to:

1.  **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Is the component doing too much? Should data fetching, complex state logic, or heavy DOM manipulation be delegated to a **Service** or a **Directive**?
2.  **State Management:** Is local state managed efficiently? Are appropriate **RxJS patterns** (e.g., `async` pipe, `BehaviorSubject`, `combineLatest`) utilized for asynchronous data, or is there excessive manual subscription/unsubscription?
3.  **Input/Output Separation:** Are `@Input()` and `@Output()` used correctly for clean parent-child communication, promoting reusability (i.e., is it a "Dumb/Presentational" component)?
4.  **Template Optimization:** Identify potential performance issues in the template (e.g., repeated complex calculations, excessive use of pure pipes where an `async` pipe would suffice, unnecessary bindings). Suggest using **`OnPush` change detection** if appropriate.

Propose refactoring actions to simplify the component and maximize its reusability and efficiency.
