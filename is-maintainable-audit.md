## Code Quality Assurance: Maintainability & Architectural Integrity

Perform a rigorous, structural analysis of the provided source code to validate its adherence to best practices for **long-term maintainability** and resilience against **architectural erosion**. The objective is to proactively identify and mitigate systemic risks associated with **tight coupling** and **low cohesion**.

Specifically, the critique must prioritize the following dimensions, recommending refactoring operations where deficiencies are observed:

1.  **Modularity & Cohesion:** Assess component separation. Verify adherence to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and evaluate the degree of **functional cohesion** within classes and modules.
2.  **Coupling & Dependencies:** Quantify and minimize inter-component dependencies. Suggest strategies (e.g., dependency injection, abstract interfaces) to promote **loose coupling** and facilitate independent evolution of code units.
3.  **Testability & Verification:** Analyze the structure for inherent testability. Identify code that presents barriers to effective **unit testing** (e.g., global state, hard-coded dependencies) and propose solutions to enable comprehensive **test coverage**.
4.  **Clarity & Abstraction:** Evaluate the clarity of naming, the effectiveness of abstraction layers, and the consistency of documentation. Ensure the code's complexity does not exceed acceptable thresholds (e.g., **Cyclomatic Complexity**).
5.  **Extensibility & Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Determine the ease with which new features can be integrated or existing behaviors modified without altering core logic ("open for extension, closed for modification").

The output must be a concise report detailing critical violations and proposing concrete **refactoring strategies** to enhance stability and reduce the **cost of change**.
